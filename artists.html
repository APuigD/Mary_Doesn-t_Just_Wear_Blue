                          Born in Moscow in 1991, <em><b>Sonya Bogdanova</b></em> is a Chicago-based artist and educator working with sculpture, painting, and performance. Her practice links materialism and esotericism to objectify representations of ruling classes. Centered on the desire for another way out, she explores how the path through horror enables action. Bogdanova holds an MFA in Studio Arts from the University of Illinois at Chicago. Selected exhibitions include Ignition Projects (Chicago), Co-Prosperity Sphere (Chi), and Flatland (Chi). Bogdanova received the Art Department Scholarship from UIC (2019-2021). She was an artist-in-residence at Holly & the Neighbors in 2021 and at Jiwar Foundation in Barcelona in 2015

                          <p> <em><b>Lu Mason</b></em>: I have been making mobiles out of cut paper, and putting up paper installations for ten years. I have focused on putting my work in public spaces, rather than galleries.  I have been working specifically with perspex for five years, and am drawn to the way that light passes through the tinted shapes.  The movement of shapes, the patterns they form, and the shadows they cast are very much part of what I am interested in.  I am self taught.  I work with a group of artists in York; our workspace is called Pica Studios.  I enjoy the exchange of ideas and methods that come with sharing studio space.

                          <em><b>Lesley Birch</b></em> was born in Glasgow in 1958 and has an MA in English Literature and Music.
                          She was a professional musician for some years before embracing her art
                          practice and studying printmaking at Harrogate College. She exhibits widely and has
                          shown and sold in the Royal Academy and the Mall Galleries. Her paintings are most often a
                          response to time and place, where she is interested in the power of paint
                          and mark-making to evoke an emotional response. Work in this exhibition is inspired by
                          Sassoferrato’s  ‘Madonna at Prayer' in the National Gallery, London. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lesleybirchart.com">www.lesleybirchart.com</a>

                              <em><b>Maria Amparo Gomar Vidal</b></em> (1983, València, Spain) studied painting at the Sant Carles Visual Arts college at the Universitat Politècnica de València. Afterwards she continued her artistic development at the Continuing Education program at the New York School of Visual Arts. In Berlin, she took a masters in Art in Context at the Universität der Künste. At the centre of her artistic motivations we find issues surrounding identity, memory, and believe. She currently lives and works in Berlin.

                            Hi! I’m <em><b>Victoria Inglés</b></em>, illustrator and graphic designer. I graduated in Fine Arts at the Universidad de Salamanca. I have always spent my time among pencils and brushes, I specialise in children’s illustration and hold a degree in it from ESDIP Madrid, and a postgraduate degree from BAU Design College of Barcelona.
                            I’m a story teller and a creator of imaginary worlds, I’m always a bit in the clouds and now I’m doing what I enjoy the most. I illustrate a bit of everythig and I don’t stick to one style, because I like changing and I believe change is always good, so you’ll never see the same thing twice in my drawings.
                          </p>

                              Illustrator and graphic designer. I grew up in Asturias, Spain, and I trained as an illustrator and graphic designer in Barcelona. I started drawing from a very young age, someone gave me paper and pen so I would sit still for a moment and I ended up liking it. So, over the years, I got interested in it and it became part of my work, my way of killing time and sometimes my way to let off steam.
