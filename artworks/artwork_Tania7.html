                        Since being 10 years of age she attended with her family the Evangelical Christian church “Oasis of Hope”, situated in South Quito, she participated in the choir of the praise band, in leadership meetings, she trusted God so much that the word of the pastors was as if it were His. The youth pastor controlled her, he did not allow her to have boyfriends, nonetheless she brought her friends to get involved in the church, and he punished her, not allowing her to sing in the praise band’s choir. She had to disclose all her projects to the pastors to receive their approval. On the 7th of July 2012, the pastor disappeared the 18 year old young woman. After 6 years and 5 months, he declared he had kidnaped her, he got her in to a car a few minutes after she said goodbye to her mother and younger brother, and then he killed her, he put her in to bin liners, he wrapped her with packing tape and threw her body into a ravine north of Quito, in the Bellavista sector. The authorities and her mother searched exhaustively for 20 days, but did not find her. In September 2018, it was dictated that the pastor should remain in preventative detention for the alleged kidnapping for ransom. In November of that year, the judge* accepted the restatement of the charges against the pastor, for crime of kidnapping for
                        ransom resulting in death. In May 2019, after 7 years, the Ecuadorian justice decid-ed to take the pastor to trial.
