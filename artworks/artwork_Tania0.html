                      This project has been created from appropriation practices in art and emerges, on the one hand from the documentary research in churches and archives, and for the
                      recovery of religious images from the colonial period of the 17th and 18th centuries
                      depicting “The Dormition of the Virgin” and which have been created by male and anonymous artists, in which the feminine icon of the Virgin Mary acts as sleeping
                      without going through death. On the other hand there was an investigation of public documents from the Attorney General’s Office, regarding cases of femicides in
                      Ecuador; therefore it also includes the familiar narrative to give visibility to the
                      phenomenon of forced disappearances.
                      <br>
                      In this manner, a parallel reading is created between the imaginary and the
                      representation of woman in Christian religion and the re-reading of these Marian
                      symbols in the present. It questions the usage of the body as an imposition of the
                      colonial values and the utopian ideal of a society based on a Christian State, its
                      educational practices, and daily community life.
